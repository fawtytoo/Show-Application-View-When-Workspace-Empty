# Show-Application-View-When-Workspace-Empty
## Gnome Shell extension

### Description
Shows the application view when the workspace is or becomes empty, such as switching to an empty workspace, when all windows on a workspace are closed, or after login. Starting applications or switching to a workspace with open windows will hide the application view if it's showing.

From version 22, this extension waits for any window closing animation to complete (if enabled) before showing the application view.
